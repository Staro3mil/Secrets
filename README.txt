This is a work in progress page that uses hashing to encrypt the data of its users (passwords). Once a user registers they will be able to see the secret. 

Cookies are also enabled, this means that after a successful login or registration you can access the "/secrets" page without having to type in your credentials again.

The "Submit" button is not yet developed.

To start this page use "nodemon app.js" and then access localhost:3000
